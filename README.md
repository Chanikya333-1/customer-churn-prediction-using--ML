# 🚀 Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting **customer churn** using a real-world **Telco customer dataset 📊**.  
The goal is to apply machine learning techniques to understand key drivers of churn and help businesses improve customer retention strategies. 

---

## 🔎 Overview

- 🔧 **Data Preprocessing**: Handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, and addressed class imbalance using SMOTE.
- 📊 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualized trends and patterns in customer behavior.
- 🤖 **Model Development**: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost algorithms to predict churn.
- 🏆 **Evaluation**: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score — best-performing model selected for deployment.

## 📂 Dataset

The project uses the **Telco Customer Churn dataset** (`WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv`), which includes:
- Demographics
- Account info
- Churn status
